8-puzzle solver
Introduction--

The 8-puzzle is a classic sliding puzzle that consists of a 3x3 grid with numbered tiles from 1 to 8 and one empty space. The goal is to move the tiles in such a way that they are arranged in the correct order.

This repository contains an implementation of an 8-puzzle solver using various search algorithms.

Algorithms Used--

1.Breadth-First Search (BFS)

2.Depth-First Search (DFS)

3.A Search (A-Star Algorithm)*
